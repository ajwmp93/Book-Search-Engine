# Book Search Engine

## Description 
I wanted to make this project so that it would be easy to search for books in one web page. This will allow users to look at many different books while seeing their images and descriptions, as well as having quick and easy links that take them to a website to buy that book. This application will also allow them to save their books to their account so they can view them at a later time, as well as delete the book when they no longer need to view it. 

## Credits
I used previous modules to help through this project, as well as some help from ChatGPT.
